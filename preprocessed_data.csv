I’ve had minor issues before but, this one is too much. Yesterday I placed an order to be picked up at work and have them take a young man who needed a ride home. He was not feeling well and so I did my best to accommodate him with an Uber in the freezing cold. Upon opening up the app it had my location at my work place. I proceeded to press the destination section and enter the address. A small amount of time goes by and a driver is assigned my order. After about a minute or so of watching the driver’s position on screen I notice he is heading away from my current location. I figured maybe he had another client to pick up and drop off before getting to me. That was not the case. I see the app changes from him being on the way to now we are on route to destination. He has picked someone up at a location approximately 2 miles away from me and is bringing them to my intended destination. I call him to ask where he is going because he has yet to pick me up. He says he is almost there! I said but who is in the car you did not pick me up? He mumbles to himself and hangs up the phone. The man had a very strong accent and spoke with limited vocabulary. Meanwhile, I’m supposed to be at work training supervisors and overseeing part our operation. My favorite was Uber’s expert anti-customer service philosophy. In short, because the destination you chose and the destination we dropped the wrong party off at we’re similar we won’t be giving you a refund. I reached out to their “help” section through the app and have received people equivalent to a wall or as I suspect an automated response system. Three people at Uber all repeated the same rhetoric. I explained multiple times you don’t get it!!! Your driver never picked me up. He never confirmed his party as is his job!!! In fact, he orchestrated giving his friend a ride on my dime and Uber team and their App support are supporting this behavior. Now they are threatening to block me as a user because I am not happy about them allowing someone to steal my money while they sit back and allow it. Resolution: take responsibility for your lack of training with your drivers, take customer service and hospitality training, learn to use the GPS function to support people’s statements when they tell you you never picked me up. Best of all their chat support actually had the Gaul to tell me they don’t have a way of contacting me via phone. You are stealing money and I want mine back.

 After years of using the service Uber I must say they never let me down. I currently hold a 4.97 rating and my drivers really represent that. Holding each other to a certain standard when driving is important. As well as mutual respect. With uber being such a simple app to navigate really anyone can use it. It offers the change to also make the right choice. aAfter a night of drinking with buddies you can get a safe, reliable ride home using this app. This is the first time something like this has been available. OF course we have taxi service but it is not the same. Drivers often offer free water and phone charger upon arrival. After being out, charging your phone is a real treat due to it generally being dead. Not only do they have regular rides you can select different vehicle options at different price points. If you need a car for a larger party you can select that when placing your pickup location. For example you're spending the day snowboarding. On the app you can request a car with a ski rack to store your gear for a warm ride back to your lodge. Another advantage to it is you see the price of the ride before it's placed so it's not a surprise. All together I really enjoy this app as a safe way to travel and a reliable way as well. I would strongly recommend it and therefore I give it a 5 star rating.",2020-07-12 22:43:00,"Awesome App Store. People looking to download the app.

 I was placing an order for delivery with my girlfriend (on her phone) and was at a different address than the last place we had ordered food from. Uber auto filled the address with the most recent and then, when I confirmed my order, gave me a two second timer to cancel with a warning saying “it looks like you’re not located near this delivery address”. I missed the cancel window (of literally two or three seconds) and then the app finalized the order and when I went to change the address, it would not allow me. When I went to cancel and reorder with the proper address, it said the fee would be $50 ( total cost of food minus fees).

I’ve been in contact with support for almost a week. I kid you not... total run around. It’s like they’ll do anything to not refund my money.

Phone support doesn’t seem to help either. I’ve been told that the chat feature will be helpful in resolving my issue but that hasn’t been true.

Since my PayPal account was charged without notice nor a receipt it gives way to let me believe that it was a fraudulent charge from the company. I’ve stated multiple times in my “support ticket” that there has to be an internal audit system to track what API calls my user makes (that would cause charged to appear). No one wants to check that. I’ve given all the payment information I can. And I’m still being asked the same questions. I don’t have a case number so I can’t paste it here, but to me this shows a true lack of transparency on how/why a charge was made and a receipt hasn’t been sent.

I want to close my account, but I do fear more fraudulent charges will come through since I can’t get an explanation on the first one, nor a reversal, nor any follow up to my comments in my “support ticket”.
